## About this project
CI/CD is a hot topic in the world of software development. It stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery), and it plays a pivotal role in modern software development processes. CI/CD is a set of practices, tools, and principles aimed at automating and streamlining the software development lifecycle.

Most modern developer tools, such as VS Code, even SAP BAS, etc. now come equipped with native Git integration. However, SAP Cloud Integration differs significantly from other development tools, and as a result, implementing a CI/CD solution for it presents unique challenges.

Getting started with this process can be relatively straightforward, but it does necessitate a certain level of familiarity with Git, pipelines, and some knowledge on any CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Bitbucket, Azure Pipelines or GitLab, among others. Moreover, you‚Äôll need to install additional tools or programs on your local computer to kickstart the CI/CD process. However, it‚Äôs important to note that while constructing a CI/CD pipeline using CI/CD tools can be relatively straightforward, resolving issues or errors in the pipeline and maintaining it demands additional skills, time, and effort. SAP customers may need to train their workforce to effectively use CI/CD tools.

As everybody is not familiar and comfortable with CI/CD tools, this project can be used as an alternative to implement the Continuous Integration (CI) & Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) capabilities for SAP Cloud Integration without using any external CI/CD tools. The goal of this project was to leverage the inherent capabilities of SAP Cloud Integration, alongside the Power of Groovy and chaining of APIs, to create a solution that aligns more closely with the platform‚Äôs core development style.

Designed with ease-of-use in mind, making it simple and straightforward to begin without the need for any additional external tools or specialized knowledge. It is designed entirely around the core building blocks and artifacts of SAP Cloud Integration, without even relying on native Git, a prerequisite for most CI/CD and DevOps tools.
