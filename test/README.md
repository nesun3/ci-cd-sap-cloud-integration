# Test Packages

*[Optional]*

- You can download the test packages from the folder [Test-Packages](Test-Packages), which you can readily use for testing. 
- You can experiment various combinations within each of the test packages and integration flows and try out the overall solution in your trial or non-production tenant.
- All types of integration artifacts [packages, iflows, value mappings] are already included with all combinations of resource types.
- Since Draft mode cannot be download, hence to test the draft mode please change the any iflows or value mapping to draft and test it out
- While you can also use your own test packages and integration flows as well, these are provided for quick reference to get you started.
